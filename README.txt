To illustrate, I have created [https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test](a github project). As you will see, there are two schema files: [https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/blob/master/src/main/torque/schema/first-schema.xml](first-schema.xml) and& [https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/blob/master/src/main/torque/schema/second-schema.xml](second-schema.xml) which includes the first. The [https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/tree/master/target/generated-sources/torque/org/grajagan](generated base classes) for tbl1 and tbl3 differ in that [https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/blob/master/target/generated-sources/torque/org/grajagan/BaseTbl3.java](BaseTbl3) has the getter methods for the link table tbl_link_int (e.g. [https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/blob/master/target/generated-sources/torque/org/grajagan/BaseTbl3.java#L168](getTblLinkInts())), whereas [https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/blob/master/target/generated-sources/torque/org/grajagan/BaseTbl1.java](BaseTbl1) does not.

I think it would be a very useful feature to be able to split a large schema into several sub-schema files and not lose the ability to generate these setters!
