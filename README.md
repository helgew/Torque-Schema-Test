I recently ran into an issue with [torque](http://db.apache.org/torque), external schemas, and the implementation of the complexDataModel flag.

To illustrate, I have created [this github project](https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test). As you will see, there are two schema files: [first-schema.xml](https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/blob/master/src/main/torque/schema/first-schema.xml) and& [second-schema.xml](https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/blob/master/src/main/torque/schema/second-schema.xml) which includes the first. The [generated base classes](https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/tree/master/target/generated-sources/torque/org/grajagan) for tbl1 and tbl3 differ in that [BaseTbl3](https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/blob/master/target/generated-sources/torque/org/grajagan/BaseTbl3.java) has the getter methods for the link table tbl_link_int (e.g. [getTblLinkInts()](https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/blob/master/target/generated-sources/torque/org/grajagan/BaseTbl3.java#L168)), whereas [BaseTbl1](https://github.com/helgew/Torque-Schema-Test/blob/master/target/generated-sources/torque/org/grajagan/BaseTbl1.java) does not.

I think it would be a very useful feature to be able to split a large schema into several sub-schema files and not lose the ability to generate these setters!
